# Solutions to Problems in Exam Prep: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Foundations

There are a few types of questions in the quizzes in the course. See the list of the question types below.

1. Multiple choice
2. Code
3. Value input/output

For type 1, start the solution with `- [x]`; for type 2, use triple backticks to create a Python code block; for type 3, use single backticks.

The graded assessments usually have 10 questions in them but there is a pool of over 10 questions for every graded assessment. Therefore, we get different questions every time we attempt the assessments. The following solutions may not all be the same as what you see when you do the assessments.
